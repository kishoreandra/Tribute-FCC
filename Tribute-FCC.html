          Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese
          pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a
          Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier
          League club Manchester United and captains the Portugal national team.
          Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as
          one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon
          d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a
          European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven
          league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European
          Championship and one UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records
          for most appearances (181), most goals (140) and assists (42) in the
          Champions League, most goals in the European Championship (14), most
          international goals by a male player (115), and most international
          appearances by a European male (184). He is one of the few players to
          have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored
          over 800 official senior career goals for club and country. Born and
          raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for
          Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18,
          winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go onto win
          three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the
          FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo
          was the subject of the then-most expensive association football
          transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth
          €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La
          Liga titles, two Copa del Rey and four Champions Leagues, and became
          the club's all-time top goalscorer. He and won back-to-back Ballons
          d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up
          three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. In 2018,
          he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million
          (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the
          most expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old. He won two
          Serie A titles, two Supercoppe Italiana and a Coppa Italia, before
          returning to Manchester United in 2021.
